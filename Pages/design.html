            <br />
            In October 2005, nineteen-year old Samy Kamkar discovered a
            vital security problem on Myspace. Seeking to exploit this flaw
            as a joke, Kamkar created a worm – a virus that replicates
            itself, automatically spreading through a network. It wasn’t
            malicious; originally meant to be a joke among friends, the
            soon-to-be-dubbed Samy worm added users who visited his profile
            as his friend, added a tag to their page saying, “but most of
            all, Samy is my hero”, and replicated the code onto the victim’s
            page, therefore continuing the distribution of the worm.

            <br /><br />
            In less than 24 hours, the Samy worm infected over 1,000,000
            accounts, completely shutting down the website, and soon
            becoming the fastest spreading virus of all time.
            <br /><br />

            <i
              >...but popularity begets popularity. I need some more
              friends. I need people to love me. I delved into the bug and
              found that I could basically control the web browsing of
              anyone who hit my profile. In fact, I was able to develop
              something that caused anyone who viewed my profile to add my
              name to their profile's list of heroes. It's villainous. I was
              ecstatic. <br /><br />
              But it wasn't enough. I needed more. So I went deeper. A
              Chipotle burrito bol and a few clicks later, anyone who viewed
              my profile who wasn't already on my friends list would
              inadvertently add me as a friend. Without their permission. I
              had conquered myspace. Veni, vidi, vici.
              <br /><br />
              But it wasn't enough.</i

            The Samy worm was born from arrogance and egotism. Though
            seemingly innocent, it identified and exploited the major
            problems with the Myspace interface, ultimately leading to its
            downfall.
